## Current Status

**What Works**:
- Dev server runs
- Load button opens file picker
- Save button downloads modified file
- Dirty tracking shows `*` when file is modified
- All UI panels are visible and styled

**What's Next**:
1. Parse `.ron` file content into structured data
2. Render entities in the Viewport canvas
3. Make entities clickable and draggable
4. Add property editing via Inspector

## How to Test

```bash
cd tools/editor-v2
pnpm dev
```

Then:
1. Click "Load"
2. Select `assets/stages/debug.sg.ron`
3. File content loads (currently just stored as text)
4. Click "Save" to download

## Migration Strategy

This editor runs **alongside** the existing Bevy editor (`tools/editor`):

1. ‚úÖ **Current**: Both editors work independently
2. üöß **Next**: Add visual editing to editor-v2
3. ‚è≥ **Future**: Achieve feature parity
4. ‚è≥ **Long-term**: editor-v2 becomes primary tool

## Notes

- No WASM - pure JavaScript/TypeScript
- No backend - runs entirely in browser
- File System Access API for Chrome/Edge (re-save to same file)
- Download fallback for Firefox/Safari
- Simple architecture, easy to extend
